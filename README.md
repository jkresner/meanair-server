#### Easy config

Adapt config for different contexts (dev / test / production) via overrides 
(passed in values) or .env files.


#### Advanced instrumentation

Easily control log output via config to understand your code or watch how users
are executing your code.


#### Opinionated globals

Libraries like underscore (lodash), moment and a few helper methods we think 
are ok to have accessible all over meanair apps.

All globals are set in `/lib/index.js`


#### Handy hooks

Conventions for automatically linking (requiring) code files placed 
in specific parts of the meanair server folder
